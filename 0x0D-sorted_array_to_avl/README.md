# 0x0D. Array to AVL

## Instructions
Write a function that builds an AVL tree from an array.
* Prototype: `avl_t *sorted_array_to_avl(int *array, size_t size);`
* `array` is a pointer to the first element of the array to be converted and `size` is the number of elements in the array.
* Your function must return a pointer to the root node of the created AVL tree, or `NULL` on failure.
* You can assume there will be no duplicate values in the array.
* You are not allowed to rotate.
* You can only have 3 functions in your file.
