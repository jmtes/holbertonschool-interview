# 0x1B. Radix Sort

## Instructions
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the radix sort algorithm.
* Prototype: `void radix_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
* You must implement the LSD radix sort algorithm.
* You may assume that `array` will contain only nunbers greater than or equal to 0.
* You are allowed to use `malloc` and `free`.
* You are expected to print the `array` each time you increase your significant digit.
