# 0x10. Rain

## Instructions
Given a list of non-negative integers representing walls of width 1, calculate how much water will be retained after it rains.
* Prototype: `def rain(walls)`
* `walls` is a list of non-negative integers.
* Function must return an integer indicating the total amount of rainwater retained.
* It can be assumed that the ends of the list (before index 0 and after the last index) are not walls and thus will not retain water.
* If the list is empty, return `0`.
