# 0x07. Linked List Cycle

## Instructions
Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list has a cycle in it.
* Prototype: `int check_cycle(listint_t *list);`
* Return `1` if there is a cycle, `0` otherwise
* You may only use the `write`, `printf`, `putchar`, `puts`, `malloc`, and `free` functions from the standard library
