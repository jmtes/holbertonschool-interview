# 0x19. Making Change

## Instructions
Given a pile of coins of different values, determine the fewest number of coins needed to meet a given amount `total`.

* Prototype: `def makeChange(coins, total)`
* Return the fewest number of coins needed to meet `total`.
* If `total` is less than or equal to `0`, return `0`.
* If `total` cannot be met by any number of coins you have, return `-1`.
* `coins` is a list of the values of the coins in your possession.
* You may assume you have an infinite number of each denomination of coin in the list.
* Your solution's runtime will be evaluated.
