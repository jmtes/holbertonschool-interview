# 0x18. Merge Sort

## Instructions
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the merge sort algorithm.

- Prototype: `void merge_sort(int *array, size_t size)`
- You must implement the top-down merge sort algorithm.
- When you divide an array into two sub-arrays, the size of the left array should always be less than or equal to the size of the right array.
- You must sort the left array before you sort the right array.
- You are allowed to use `printf`.
- You are allowed to call `malloc` and `free` only once.
