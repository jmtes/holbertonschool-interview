# 0x0B. Heap Sort

## Instructions
Write a function that sorts an array of integers in ascending order using the heap sort algorithm.
* Prototype: `void heap_sort(int *array, size_t size);`
* You must implement the sift-down heap sort algorithm.
* You must print the array after each swap.
* If `size` is less than 2, `array` does not need to be sorted.
